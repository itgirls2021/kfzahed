        <h2> My thoughts on Cryptography after IT girls session</h2>
        <p> By: Kanzah Zahed, 21st July 2021</p>

        <p>Cryptography is a fascinating area to learn. Since in Pakistan cryptology is a lesser-known field, it was something I did not know much about. Now that I am cognisant about it, I am starting to see all the impacts of cryptology in my everyday life. Cryptology is keeping data transfer safe over the internet, including our private information such as our phone number, address, banking details, etc. when I am doing online shopping. Also, when saving/resetting my passwords on my devices, is encryption happening in the background.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe cryptography is a beneficial tool and can be used immensely in keeping sensitive data secure. By encrypting data, data becomes meaningless to the third-party hackers and ensures that only the sender and receiver can know the message. For example, through hashing algorithm message remains safe as it is useless to those who intercepted it. Cryptography has huge potential. In the field of cybersecurity, it can develop to a colossal extent. As more and more data is coming on the internet, we will be needing better encryption methods to secure the data integrity and confidentiality for the users. </p>
