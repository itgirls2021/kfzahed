        <h2>Game Designing like Creating Magic!</h2>
        <p>Kanzah Zahed, 2nd August 2021</p>

        <p>A few days back, I had an incredible session about Game Design as part of the Itgirls course. Our guest presenter, Miss Racquel Gonzalez emphasised the importance of women in video gaming history and covered crucial aspects of game design. Then, there was an exciting challenge for all of the participant-to plan your very own game design. We were assigned with groups and topics and it was the time to roll up our sleeves and get started.</p>
        <p>My team's topic was 'how could climate change impact my neighbourhood and others'. I gathered up all the thoughts I had, such as game objectives and features and started incorporating them into our shared google presentation and see it all come together. My fellow team members were absolutely great; we kept sharing our thoughts back and forth and come together as a single condensed idea.</p>
        <p>The game we created is called 'ONECRW', in which players are supposed to understand the effects of climate change and one's accountability towards it. In this game, players are supposed to overcome the challenges of extreme climate.  These climatic conditions are going to be inspired by actual climatic events such as forest fires in Australia, floods in Pakistan, hurricanes in Texas, earthquakes in japan etc.</p>
        
        <p>There will be specific missions for reversal of climate change such as planting trees, cleaning rivers and stopping oil spills. These will depend on where you decide to play on the map, for example, if you select the coastline, beach clean-up will be one of the tasks. Our game map will look something like this

        <a href=" Reddit My huge 12k by 12k Minecraft survival/adventure map is complete, with over 300 unique structures, 13 custom villages, challenging dungeons, special weapons, a fast travel system, and more. Download in the comments.:">picture source for the game map</a>
        <p>I thought it would be nice to design an original game cover as most games have it. I went on with creating it real quick and nearly in 10 minutes, I made this:</p>
        <img src="gamecover.png" alt="original game cover">
        <p>On the top portion of the poster, there is scenery with greenery and serenity while the bottom is exactly the opposite of it showing a barren, dystopian landscape. I made this to depict the contrast between the two landscapes and show what consequences of climate change if we do not take action. I used bold metal letters to accentuate the game name.</p>

        <h2> My thoughts on Cryptography after IT girls session</h2>
        <p> By: Kanzah Zahed, 21st July 2021</p>
     
     

      <p>Cryptography is a fascinating area to learn. Since in Pakistan cryptology is a lesser-known field, it was something I did not know much about. Now that I am cognisant about it, I am starting to see all the impacts of cryptology in my everyday life. Cryptology is keeping data transfer safe over the internet, including our private information such as our phone number, address, banking details, etc. when I am doing online shopping. Also, when saving/resetting my passwords on my devices, is encryption happening in the background.
        </p>

        <p>
            I believe cryptography is a beneficial tool and can be used immensely in keeping sensitive data secure. By encrypting data, data becomes meaningless to the third-party hackers and ensures that only the sender and receiver can know the message. For example, through hashing algorithm message remains safe as it is useless to those who intercepted it. Cryptography has huge potential. In the field of cybersecurity, it can develop to a colossal extent. As more and more data is coming on the internet, we will be needing better encryption methods to secure the data integrity and confidentiality for the users. </p>
