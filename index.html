         Hey there everyone!! I am a rising senior from Karachi, Pakistan. I have lived in Pakistan my entire life, where it is uncommon for girls to pursue technology and computer science. I am looking forward to gaining exposure and meeting like-minded people from the United States and other parts of the globe. Since my childhood, I have been passionate about Computer Science and IT. My future aspiration is to become a sucessful computer scientist and inspire younger girls to pursue IT. My interests are web development, coding, and cybersecurity. During quarantine, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS through Youtube; I can design somewhat good websites. I am incredibly excited to learn and explore the world of IT with all of you!

         In my free time, I like to listen to music, read books and watch movies. The recent film I watched was Disney Cruella, and I really liked it. My favorite songs are 'Willow by Taylor Swift' and 'Levitating by Dua Lipa.' 
         
         
         Can't wait to see you all, learn from great instructors, have lots of fun, and discover more about technology!! :)
         
         
         Lots of love,
         Kanzah
