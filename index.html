             Hey there everyone!! I am a rising senior from Karachi, Pakistan.
             I have lived in Pakistan my entire life, where it is uncommon for girls to pursue technology and computer science.
             I am looking forward to gaining exposure and meeting like-minded people from the United States and other parts of the globe. Since my childhood, I have been passionate about Computer Science and IT. My future aspiration is to become a sucessful computer scientist and inspire younger girls to pursue IT. My interests are web development, coding, and cybersecurity. During quarantine, I learned the basics of HTML and CSS through Youtube; I can design somewhat good websites. I am incredibly excited to learn and explore the world of IT with all of you!

              In my free time, I like to listen to music, read books and watch movies. The recent film I watched was Disney Cruella, and I really liked it. My favorite songs are 'Willow by Taylor Swift' and 'Levitating by Dua Lipa.'
